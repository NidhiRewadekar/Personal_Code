  <p class="title">Climate Change</p>
  <p class="definition"><a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change" target="_blank">Climate Change</a> refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.</p>
  
  <p class="paragraph">Causes of Climate Change:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/climate-change/causes-of-climate-change" target="_blank">Burning Fossil Fuels</a> -Fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal contain carbon dioxide that has been 'locked away' in the ground for thousands of years. When we take these out of the land and burn them, we release the stored carbon dioxide into the air.</li>
    <br>

    <li><a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/causes-effects-climate-change" target="_blank">Cutting Down Forests</a> -Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other reasons, causes emissions, since trees, when they are cut, release the carbon they have been storing. Since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits nature’s ability to keep emissions out of the atmosphere.</li>
    <br>

    <li><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/what-are-causes-climate-change#industry" target="_blank">Industry and Manufacturing</a> -Most industrial emissions come from the production of a small set of carbon-intensive products, including basic chemicals, iron and steel, cement and concrete, aluminum, glass, and paper. To manufacture the building blocks of our infrastructure and the vast array of products demanded by consumers, producers must burn through massive amounts of energy.</li>
    <br>

    <li><a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/causes-effects-climate-change" target="_blank">Generating Power</a> -Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes a large chunk of global emissions. Most electricity is still generated by burning coal, oil, or gas, which produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide –powerful greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth and trap the sun’s heat.</li>
    <br>

    <li><a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/climate-change/causes-of-climate-change" target="_blank">Volcanic Eruptions</a> -Volcanoes have a mixed effect on our climate. Eruptions produce aerosol particles that cool Earth, but they also release carbon dioxide, which warms it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="paragraph">Prevention of Climate Change:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/stories/climate-action/" target="_blank">Eating less dairy and meat</a> -Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact on the planet. </li>
    <br>

    <li><a href="https://www.un.org/en/actnow/ten-actions#drive-less" target="_blank">Throw away less food</a> -When you throw food away, you're also wasting the resources and energy that were used to grow, produce, package, and transport it. And when food rots in a landfill, it produces methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.</li>
    <br>

    <li><a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/challenges/climate-change/solutions-climate-change/" target="_blank">Reduce Plastic Use</a> -Plastic doesn’t break down quickly in nature so a lot of plastic is burned, which contributes to emissions.</li>
    <br>

    <li><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/stories/climate-action/" target="_blank">Reduce your energy use, and bills</a> -Small changes to your behaviour at home will help you use less energy, cutting your carbon footprint and your energy bills:

      Turn off lights and appliances when you don’t need them.
      
      Replace light bulbs with LEDs or other low-energy lights.</li>
    <br>

    <li><a href="https://www.un.org/en/actnow/ten-actions#drive-less" target="_blank">Walk, bike, or take public transport</a> -Walking or riding a bike instead of driving will reduce greenhouse gas emissions -- and help your health and fitness. For longer distances, consider taking a train or bus. And carpool whenever possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="paragraph">Effects of Climate Change:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/causes-effects-climate-change" target="_blank">Increased Drought</a> -Climate change is changing water availability, making it scarcer in more regions. Global warming exacerbates water shortages in already water-stressed regions and is leading to an increased risk of agricultural droughts affecting crops, and ecological droughts increasing the vulnerability of ecosystems.</li>
    <br>

    <li><a href="https://www.bgs.ac.uk/discovering-geology/climate-change/impacts-of-climate-change/" target="_blank">Melting of Ice</a> -Worldwide, glaciers are shrinking rapidly and ice appears to be melting faster than previously estimated. In areas dependent on meltwater from mountains, changes in water flow and availability can lead to a lack of water and even drought.</li>
    <br>

    <li><a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/causes-effects-climate-change" target="_blank">Loss of Species</a> -Climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in the ocean. These risks increase as temperatures climb. Exacerbated by climate change, the world is losing species at a rate 1,000 times greater than at any other time in recorded human history.</li>
    <br>

    <li><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/SR15_Chapter3_Low_Res.pdf"target="_blank" >Human Health</a> -Changing weather patterns are associated with shifts in the geographic range, seasonality and transmission intensity of selected climate-sensitive infectious diseases</li>
    <br>

    <li><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/what-are-effects-climate-change#agriculture" target="_blank">Reduced Soil Health</a> -Healthy soil has good moisture and mineral content and is teeming with bugs, bacteria, fungi, and microbes that in turn contribute to healthy crops. But climate change, particularly extreme heat and changes in precipitation, can degrade soil quality.</li>
  </ul>
  <!--<p class="paragraph">Effects of waste on climate change:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/ecenter/2020/12/10/waste-and-its-contribution-climate-change" target="_blank">Carbon Emmissions</a> -Plastic waste produces greenhouse gas emissions during every stage of its lifecycle. The extraction and transportation of plastic is dependent on oil, gas, and coal. The production and disposal of plastics also release tons of carbon emissions.</li>
  </ul>-->
  <div id="Food Waste"></div>
  <p class="title">Food Waste</p> 

  <p class="definition"><a href="https://www.fao.org/3/i3347e/i3347e.pdf" target="_blank">Food Waste</a> refers to food appropriate for human consumption being discarded, whether or not after it is kept beyond its expiry date or left to spoil. </p>
 <!--add this to github-->

 <p class="paragraph">Causes of Food Waste:</p>
 <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/explore-how-farmers-produce-food-sustainably/0/steps/60783" target="_blank">Unfavourable market conditions</a>  -Farmers choose to waste their crops when their returns are not breaking even the costs of labour, transportation and packaging. This is more prevalent nowadays that farmers face labour shortages.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://www.fao.org/flw-in-fish-value-chains/value-chain/consumption/consumer-food-waste/en/" target="_blank">Improper storage</a>  -Food spoilage at home occurs due to, lack of visibility in refrigerators, partially used ingredients and misjudged food needs.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://eportfolios.macaulay.cuny.edu/koutavas3/background-info/" target="_blank">Appearance quality standards</a>  -Edible food may be rejected by supermarkets due to crops not being favorable in terms of weight, size, or shape.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/explore-how-farmers-produce-food-sustainably/0/steps/60783" target="_blank">Losses from farm incidents</a>  -A bad quality grain or produce that does not meet the distributors’ standards may yield harvesting a crop even more costly and wasteful of farm’s equipment and resources.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://www.fao.org/flw-in-fish-value-chains/value-chain/consumption/consumer-food-waste/en/" target="_blank">Large Portions</a>  -Restaurants meals are often left uneaten and edible leftovers are often left at the restaurant.</li>
</ul>

  <p class="paragraph"> Prevention of food waste:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/fight-climate-change-by-preventing-food-waste" target="_blank">Using the freezer</a>  -While there are plenty of benefits to eating fresh food, frozen foods can be just as nutritious. They also stay edible for much longer. Cooking and freezing food—especially produce—before it goes bad is a great way to avoid having to toss it.</li>
    <br>
    <li><a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/food-banks/10-ways-to-cut-your-food-waste" target="_blank">Measuring portions</a>  -Reduce waste by cooking only the amount you need. Measuring takes away the guesswork and makes it more likely you’ll get the right amount.</li>
    <br>
    <li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/reduce-food-waste#TOC_TITLE_HDR_17" target="_blank">Composting</a>  -Composting leftover food is a beneficial way to reuse food scraps, turning food waste into energy for plants.</li>
    <br>
    <li><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/fight-climate-change-by-preventing-food-waste" target="_blank">Blend, bake, or boil</a>  -Try using your wilting, browning, or imperfect produce to make sweet smoothies, bread, jams, sauces, or soup stocks.</li>
    <br>
    <li><a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/food-banks/10-ways-to-cut-your-food-waste" target="_blank">Having a list</a>  -Make a shopping list and stick to it when you go shopping. Plan ahead and shop with specific meals in mind.</li>
  </ul>

 <p class="paragraph"> Effects of food waste:</p> 
 <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/end-food-waste-day" target="_blank">Loss of resources</a>  -When food is lost or wasted, all the resources that were used to produce this food - including water, land, energy, labour and capital - go to waste.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/fight-climate-change-by-preventing-food-waste" target="_blank">Methane Production</a>  -When we waste food, we also waste all the energy and water it takes to grow, harvest, transport, and package it. And if food goes to the landfill and rots, it produces methane—a greenhouse gas even more potent than carbon dioxide. About 6%-8% of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced if we stop wasting food.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/end-food-waste-day" target="_blank">Increased cost of food</a>  -Food loss and waste can also negatively impact food security and food availability, and contribute to increasing the cost of food. </li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://moveforhunger.org/the-environmental-impact-of-food-waste" target="_blank">Loss of water</a>  -With agriculture accounting for 70 percent of the water used throughout the world, food waste also represents a great waste of fresh water and groundwater resources. By throwing out two pounds of beef, you are essentially wasting 50,000 liters of water that were used to produce that meat. In the same way, nearly 1,000 liters of water are wasted when you pour one glass of milk down the drain.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://earth.org/how-does-food-waste-affect-the-environment/" target="_blank">Harm to Biodiversity</a>  -Deforestation and conversion of our natural lands into non-arable land destroys the natural flora and fauna present, and in some cases, to the point of their extinction. </li>
</ul>

<div id="Electronic Waste"></div>
<p class="title">Electronic Waste</p>
<p class="definition"><a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-ewaste-and-what-can-we-do-about-it.html" target="_blank">Electronic Waste</a> refers to anything with plugs, cords and electronic components. Common sources of e-waste include televisions, computers, mobile phones and any type of home appliance, from air conditioners to children's toys.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Causes of electronic waste:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://are.berkeley.edu/~sberto/ewaste.pdf" target="_blank">Electrical Components</a>  -Items that contain numerous electrical components, generate the largest amount of e‐waste.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://earth.org/e-waste-pollution/" target="_blank">Unsure Disposal</a>  -Some people will simply throw out old devices into their household trash when they can be recycled or repaired.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://are.berkeley.edu/~sberto/ewaste.pdf" target="_blank">Multiple Product Generations</a>  -Years of R&D, multiple product generations, and consumers willingness to “upgrade”, creates a constant supply of this type of waste.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-report-time-seize-opportunity-tackle-challenge-e-waste" target="_blank">Lack of Recycling</a>  -Less than 20% of e-waste is formally recycled, with 80% either ending up in landfill or being informally recycled.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://are.berkeley.edu/~sberto/ewaste.pdf" target="_blank">Use of chemicals</a>  -Manufactures need to use certain chemicals, elements, and compounds to synthesize a final consumer product.</li>
</ul>

<p class="paragraph"> Prevention of electronic waste:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://green.harvard.edu/tools-resources/how/6-ways-minimize-your-e-waste" target="_blank">Extend the life of your electronics</a>  -Buy a case, keep your device clean, and avoid overcharging the battery.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-ewaste-and-what-can-we-do-about-it.html" target="_blank">Find opportunities for reuse</a>  -If the item is still in good working order or requires only minor repairs, think about giving it to someone else.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2018/08/27/growing-e-waste-problem/" target="_blank">Seal broken parts</a>  -Before you recycle your device, seal up any broken parts in separate containers so that hazardous chemicals don’t leak. Wear latex gloves and a mask if you’re handling something that’s broken.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/waste-management/recycling-disposal/batteries-faq.html#1" target="_blank">Recycle Batteries</a>  -Recycling batteries significantly reduces the dangers these batteries pose to human health and the environment by diverting them from landfills and incinerators.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2018/08/27/growing-e-waste-problem/" target="_blank">Revaluate</a>  -The best thing you can do is to resist buying a new device until you really need it. Try to get your old product repaired if possible and if it can’t be fixed, resell or recycle it responsibly.</li>
</ul>

 <p class="paragraph"> Effects of electronic waste:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/the-human-and-environmental-effects-of-e-waste/" target="_blank">Burning e-waste</a>  -Combustion from burning e-waste creates fine particulate matter, which is linked to pulmonary and cardiovascular disease.</li>

 <li><a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_A_New_Circular_Vision_for_Electronics.pdf" target="_blank">Pollution</a>  -E-waste can pollute water sources and food supply chains.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://dig.watch/topics/e-waste" target="_blank">Harm to workers and communities</a>  -The informal and unregulated management of e-waste poses a serious risk to the health and well-being of both workers and communities as a whole, due to the substantial amount of harmful components such as mercury, lead, bromine, and arsenic that our devices contain.</li>
</ul>

<div id="Biodiversity Loss"></div>
<p class="title">Biodiversity Loss</p>

 <p class="definition"><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/what-is-biodiversity" target="_blank">Biodiversity</a> refers to all the different kinds of life you’ll find in one area—the variety of animals, plants, fungi, and even microorganisms like bacteria that make up our natural world.</p>

 <p class="definition"><a href="https://earth.org/biodiversity-loss-definition-and-examples/" target="_blank">Biodiversity loss </a> refers to the loss of life on Earth at various levels, ranging from reductions in the genetic diversity to the collapse of entire ecosystems.</p>
 
 <p class="paragraph">Causes of biodiversity loss:</p>
 <ul>
  <li><a href="https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/biodiversity/human-impact-on-biodiversity/" target="_blank">Deforestation</a>  -Tropical rainforests are particularly rich in biodiversity and are being destroyed.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-are-the-extent-and-causes-of-biodiversity-loss/" target="_blank">Climate Change</a>  -The climate crisis is a leading cause of biodiversity loss and is expected to become the main cause as it intensifies. Climate change is negatively affecting the timing and synchronisation of ecological events like leaf budding, insect hatchings and egg-laying by birds, causing major disruption to species interactions.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://earth.org/causes-of-biodiversity-loss/" target="_blank">By-Catch</a>  -Bycatch refers to large amounts of unwanted sea animals being captured during the fishing for a particular species and then are discarded as waste, causing the unnecessary loss of billions of fish and sea creatures.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/study/learn-about-the-causes-of-biodiversity-loss" target="_blank">Pollution</a>  -In a polluted area the quality of food, water, or other habitat resources declines, sometimes to the point where some species must move away or perish if the pressure is too great.</li>
  <br>
  <li><a href="https://earth.org/causes-of-biodiversity-loss/" target="_blank">Wildlife Poaching</a>  -The illegal wildlife trade is the biggest direct threat to many of the world’s most threatened species and one of the biggest causes of biodiversity loss. Wildlife animals are both legally and illegally caught and harvested for food, trophies, status symbols, tourist ornaments and allegedly medicinal purposes.</li>
 </ul>

 <p class="paragraph"> Prevention of biodiversity loss:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2020/why-should-we-care-about-biodiversity-loss-and-what-can-we-do-about-it" target="_blank">Encourage biodiversity</a>  -Encourage wildlife in your own garden by planting native and pollinator friendly species.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://earth.org/solutions-to-biodiversity-loss/" target="_blank">Substitute Products</a>  -One of the most simplest solutions to biodiversity loss is by substitute products with sustainable and environmentally-friendly replacements. </li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2020/why-should-we-care-about-biodiversity-loss-and-what-can-we-do-about-it" target="_blank">Educate yourself and others</a>  -Educate yourself and others on the importance of biodiversity conservation, on local plant and animal life, and on important wildlife habitats in your area. </li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://earth.org/solutions-to-biodiversity-loss/" target="_blank">Funding Directed to Innovative Solutions</a>  -Technology is advancing at such a rapid pace, so directing funding and research into technological biodiversity loss prevention methods can be extremely beneficial. </li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.naturetrust.bc.ca/conserving-land/what-can-we-do" target="_blank">Native Plants Undisturbed</a>  -Leave native plants undisturbed, and landscape using native trees and vegetation. Native plants are well adapted to local conditions and provide a low maintenance, drought resistant garden and can prevent local flooding.</li>
</ul>

<p class="paragraph"> Effects of biodiversity loss:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/biodiversity-loss/Ecological-effects" target="_blank">Lowers ecological productivity</a>  -Declining biodiversity lowers an ecosystem’s productivity and lowers the quality of the ecosystem’s services.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://earth.org/data_visualization/how-could-the-loss-of-biodiversity-affect-humans/" target="_blank">Unsustainable economy</a>  -Losing biodiversity leads to an unsustainable economy and leaves communities with reduced health and well-being standards.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.bupa.com/news/stories-and-insights/2021/loss-of-biodiversity-and-human-health" target="_blank">Increased risk of infectious disease</a>  -Biodiversity loss and an increasing rate of wildlife–human contacts all contribute to increasing risks of infectious disease. As a result of human actions, wild animals are shifting their geographical reach and moving ever closer to humans and livestock. This increases the risk of trans-species transmission of diseases.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/biodiversity-loss/Ecological-effects" target="_blank">Ecosystem homogenization</a>  -Specialist species are often the most vulnerable to dramatic population declines and extinction when conditions change. On the other hand, generalist species and species favoured by human beings become the major players in ecosystems vacated by specialist species.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.bupa.com/news/stories-and-insights/2021/loss-of-biodiversity-and-human-health" target="_blank">Compromised medicines supply and research</a>  -It is estimated that between 50,000-70,000 plant species are harvested for traditional or modern medicine. Decreased biodiversity poses a real threat to new and emerging therapeutic options.</li>
</ul>

<p class="sub_title">Air Pollution</p>

 <p class="definition"><a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_1" target="_blank">Air Pollution</a> refers to the contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere.</p>
 
 <p class="paragraph"> Causes of air pollution:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/air-quality-explaining-air-pollution/air-quality-explaining-air-pollution-at-a-glance#sources-of-air-pollution" target="_blank">Particulate matter</a>  -Particulate matter is everything in the air that isn’t gas. This includes natural sources like pollen, sea spray and desert dust. PM can get into the lungs and blood and be transported around the body, lodging in the heart, brain and other organs.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.science.org.au/curious/people-medicine/where-does-air-pollution-come" target="_blank">Manufacturing industries</a>  -The exhaust from factories usually includes particulates and gases such as oxides of nitrogen and sulphur, sometimes carbon monoxide, and a range of organic compounds, some of which are cancer-causing.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.pca.state.mn.us/air-water-land-climate/air-quality-and-health" target="_blank">Biological pollutants</a>  -Biological pollutants such as mold, pollen, animal dander, dust mites, and cockroaches—may trigger breathing problems, allergic symptoms, or asthma attacks.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.cleanairhub.org.uk/clean-air-information/the-basic-information/what-is-air-pollution#gases" target="_blank">Chemicals</a>  -There are lots of chemicals which can create air pollution including those known as Volatile Organic Compounds or VOCs. This is the name for a group of chemicals that start as liquids or solids, but disperse into the air very easily. Once the chemicals mix with the air, they become very easy for us to breathe in and can have harmful effects.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/07/what-causes-indoor-air-pollution-sources-how-to-reduce/" target="_blank">Tobacco smoke</a>  -Tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, including at least 70 that are carcinogenic. When inhaled, these chemicals can also cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other cardiovascular diseases that result in heart attacks and other serious consequences.</li>

 <ul>
 <li><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/air-pollution-everything-you-need-know#causes" target="_blank">Smog and soot</a>  -Smog can irritate the eyes and throat and also damage the lungs, especially those of children, senior citizens, and people who work or exercise outdoors.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-air-pollution/health-matters-air-pollution#how-air-pollution-harms-health" target="_blank">Asthma</a>  -Asthma, a long-term inflammatory condition of the conducting airways of the lungs, leads to cough, wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. There is increasing evidence of air pollution having a potential role in causing asthma, especially in people who live near busy roads, as well as being a trigger that can make an asthmatic’s symptoms worse.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/air-quality/effects-air-pollution" target="_blank">Harm to plants</a>  -Plants and crops grow less when exposed to long-term air pollution. It does so by damaging structures called stomata, which are tiny pores on the underside of leaves that allow the plant to "breathe."</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-air-pollution/health-matters-air-pollution#how-air-pollution-harms-health" target="_blank">Cardiovascular disease</a>  -There is strong evidence for the effects of both short and long-term exposures to air pollution on CVD in adults. The risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction (heart attacks), arrhythmias (abnormal rhythms of the heart) and stroke is increased by both short and long-term exposure to air pollution in susceptible individuals. This includes older people and individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular and respiratory conditions.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/air-quality/effects-air-pollution" target="_blank">Hole in the Ozone Layer</a>  -The hole in the ozone layer is caused by air pollutants. The ozone layer blocks harmful ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation from the Sun. Exposure to UVB increases the risk of skin cancer in humans, restricts growth and development in plants, slows the development of fish and amphibians, and reduces the number of phytoplankton in marine ecosystems.</li>

<p class="sub_title">Water Pollution</p>

<p class="definition"><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/water-pollution-everything-you-need-know#whatis" target="_blank">Water Pollution</a> occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment.</p>

<p class="paragraph"> Causes of water pollution:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><a href="https://earth.org/what-are-the-causes-of-water-pollution/" target="_blank">Sewage and Wastewater</a>  -Households release sewage and wastewater, which makes its way to the ocean, mixing with freshwater and affecting the water quality and marine life.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://online.ecok.edu/articles/causes-of-water-pollution/" target="_blank">Oil Leaks and Spills</a>  -Large oil spills and oil leaks, while often accidental, are a major cause of water pollution. Leaks and spills often are caused by oil drilling operations in the ocean or ships that transport oil.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://earth.org/what-are-the-causes-of-water-pollution/" target="_blank">Industrial Waste</a>  -The toxic chemicals leached from industrial waste can make the water unsafe for human consumption, and they can also cause the temperature in freshwater systems to change, making them dangerous for marine life.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://online.ecok.edu/articles/causes-of-water-pollution/" target="_blank">Agriculture</a>  -When chemicals and pesticides seep into the groundwater, they can harm animals, plants and humans. Additionally, when it rains, the chemicals mix with rainwater, which then flows into rivers and streams that filter into the ocean, causing further water pollution.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.water-pollution.org.uk/nuclear-waste/" target="_blank">Radioactive Substances</a>  -Nuclear waste is produced from industrial, medical and scientific processes that use radioactive material. Nuclear waste can have detrimental effects on marine habitats.</li>
</ul>

<p class="paragraph"> Prevention of water pollution:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><a href="https://online.ecok.edu/articles/causes-of-water-pollution/" target="_blank">Don’t flush trash</a>  -Being mindful not to flush non-degradable products, such as plastic, down your toilet is one small but great way to stop contributing to the problem.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://earth.org/what-are-the-causes-of-water-pollution/" target="_blank">Use phosphate-free detergents</a>  -Phosphates lead to algae blooms and kill fish and other aquatic animals by reducing the oxygen in the water. </li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://online.ecok.edu/articles/causes-of-water-pollution/" target="_blank">Maintain your car</a>  -Antifreeze, oil, coolant and other chemicals can leak out of your car if it’s not properly cared for. Then, rainwater washes those chemicals into the groundwater supply.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://earth.org/what-are-the-causes-of-water-pollution/" target="_blank">Plastic consumption</a>  -Reduce your plastic consumption and reuse or recycle plastic when you can.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.water-pollution.org.uk/prevent-water-pollution/" target="_blank">Don’t throw litter</a>  -Don’t throw litter into rivers, lakes or oceans. Help clean up any litter you see on beaches or in rivers and lakes, make sure it is safe to collect the litter and put it in a nearby dustbin.</li>
</ul>

<p class="paragraph"> Effects of water pollution:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/water-pollution-everything-you-need-know#effects" target="_blank">Diseases</a>  -Waterborne pathogens, in the form of disease-causing bacteria and viruses from human and animal waste, are a major cause of illness from contaminated drinking water.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.iberdrola.com/sustainability/water-pollution" target="_blank">Contamination of the food chain</a>  - Fishing in polluted waters and the use of waste water for livestock farming and agriculture can introduce toxins into foods which are harmful to our health when eaten.</li>

<div id="Soil Pollution"></div>
<p class="sub_title">Soil Pollution</p>

<p class="definition"><a href="https://www.fao.org/3/I9183EN/i9183en.pdf" target="_blank">Soil Pollution</a> refers to the presence of a chemical or substance out of place and/or present at a higher than normal concentration that has adverse effects on any non-targeted organism.</p>

<p class="paragraph"> Causes of soil pollution:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><a href="https://www.permaculturenews.org/2017/04/03/38249/" target="_blank">Deforestation</a>  -Clearing of trees leaves soil exposed to the elements so they are easily carried away by soil erosion. This leaves land barren and incapable of supporting vegetation.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.fao.org/3/I9183EN/i9183en.pdf" target="_blank">Industrial Activities</a>  -Gaseous pollutants and radionuclides are released to the atmosphere and can enter the soil directly through acid rain or atmospheric deposition; former industrial land can be polluted by incorrect chemical storage or direct discharge of waste into the soil.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.fao.org/fao-stories/article/en/c/1126974/" target="_blank">Poor agricultural practices</a>  -Unsustainable agricultural practices reduce soil organic matter, compromising soils’ capacity to degrade organic pollutants. This increases the risk of the pollutants being released into the environment.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.permaculturenews.org/2017/04/03/38249/" target="_blank">Excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides</a>  -The increased demand for food has forced farmers to use fertilisers and pesticides that release nothing but toxins into the soil, killing useful microorganisms that are important in plant growth.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.fao.org/3/I9183EN/i9183en.pdf" target="_blank">Mining</a>  -Toxic mining wastes are stocked up in tailings, mainly formed by fine particles that can have different concentrations of heavy metals. These polluted particles can be dispersed by wind and water erosion, sometimes reaching agricultural soils.</li>
</ul>

<p class="paragraph"> Prevention of soil pollution:</p>
 <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.permaculturenews.org/2017/04/03/38249/" target="_blank">Use biodegradable products</a>  -Where possible, opt to use biodegradable products such as cartons for packaging; if they were to be disposed of, they would easily be broken down to become part of the soil.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://dtsc.ca.gov/pollution-prevention-in-the-garden/" target="_blank">No pesticides</a>  -Do not fertilize or spray pesticides when rain is forecast within 24 hours. Stormwater runoff can carry fertilizer and pesticides to the drain system and then the local creek degrading water quality.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.permaculturenews.org/2017/04/03/38249/" target="_blank">Reforestation</a>  -Most countries have policies that require its citizens to plant more trees where one has been cut. This is an effective measure to curb soil erosion.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.iberdrola.com/sustainability/soil-pollution-causes-effects-solutions" target="_blank">Involve local communitites</a>  -Involve local communities and indigenous peoples in the design, implementation and assessment of sustainable land and soil management.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://dtsc.ca.gov/pollution-prevention-in-the-garden/" target="_blank">Control weeds</a>  -Control weeds by hand picking them and then applying mulch from wood chips or grass clippings. This mulch acts as a natural fertilizer, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.</li>
</ul>

<p class="paragraph"> Effects of soil pollution:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><a href="https://www.iberdrola.com/sustainability/soil-pollution-causes-effects-solutions" target="_blank">Damage to health</a>  -Soil pollutants enter our body through the food chain, causing illnesses. Moreover, the spread of antibiotics in the environment increases the pathogens' resistance to these drugs.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.fao.org/fao-stories/article/en/c/1126974/" target="_blank">Soils’ capacity to filter</a>  -Soils act as a filter and buffer for contaminants. The potential of soil to cope with the strain of pollutants is finite. If soil’s capacity to protect us is exceeded, contaminants will seep into other parts of the environment.</li>
 <br>
 <li><a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/soil-pollution-risk-our-health-and-food-security" target="_blank">New pests and diseases</a>  -Soil pollution can lead to the emergence of new pests and diseases by changing the balance of ecosystems and causing the disappearance of predators or competing species that regulate their biomass.</li>
